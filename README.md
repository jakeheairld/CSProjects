## Research Projects

### **Porous Material Simulation & Mesh Generation Toolkit (Integrated Multi-Physics Laboratory)**
A suite of Python tools developed during my work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the **Integrated Multi-Physics Laboratory** at the University of Utah.  
These scripts support ongoing computational research on porous materials and fracture mechanics.

**Key Capabilities**
- **Automated mesh generation** for porous microstructures using circles, ellipses, and highly irregular pore geometries  
- **Parallel and multi-threaded mesh construction** to accelerate large-scale simulations  
- **RVE (Representative Volume Element) generation workflows** for statistical homogenization  
- **CEFF (Critical Effective Fracture Factor) calculations** used to predict fracture behavior in porous materials  
- **Geometry and mesh preprocessing utilities**, including file conversion pipelines for preparing inputs to external solvers  
- **Reproducible pore-generation algorithms** with deterministic or stochastic sampling options  
- **Built-in visualization tools** for mesh inspection and validation  

These tools remain in active use in the lab for generating datasets, performing fracture-based evaluations, and prototyping new material configurations.

## Coursework Projects

Selected projects from core Computer Science courses at the University of Utah, including:
- **Software Practice** (Spreadsheet system, dependency graphs, formula evaluation engine)
- **Programming Languages** (Interpreters, type systems, lazy evaluation, control operators)
- **Computer Systems** (Malloc lab, tiny shell, caching/TLB exercises)
- **Data Analysis** (Gradient descent, linear regression, polynomial models)

Each folder includes representative code that demonstrates algorithm design, debugging, testing, and system-level programming.
