## 🔬 Research Projects (Integrated Multi-Physics Laboratory)

### **Porous Material Simulation & Mesh Generation Toolkit**
A suite of Python tools developed during my work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the **Integrated Multi-Physics Laboratory** at the University of Utah.  
These scripts support ongoing computational research on porous materials and fracture mechanics.

**Key Capabilities**
- **Automated mesh generation** for porous microstructures using circles, ellipses, and highly irregular pore geometries  
- **Parallel and multi-threaded mesh construction** to accelerate large-scale simulations  
- **RVE (Representative Volume Element) generation workflows** for statistical homogenization  
- **CEFF (Critical Effective Fracture Factor) calculations** used to predict fracture behavior in porous materials  
- **Geometry and mesh preprocessing utilities**, including file conversion pipelines for preparing inputs to external solvers  
- **Reproducible pore-generation algorithms** with deterministic or stochastic sampling options  
- **Built-in visualization tools** for mesh inspection and validation  

These tools remain in active use in the lab for generating datasets, performing fracture-based evaluations, and prototyping new material configurations.
